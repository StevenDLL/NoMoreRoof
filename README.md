# NoMoreRoof
Valheim Mod that uses BepInEx and 0Harmony to inject a new script into the game which makes it that you don't need a roof or any surrounding walls to use the workbench.
The mod also makes it so you are able to sleep without a fire, while wet and outside.

To be able to use this you are required to build your own DLL using this script in Visual Studio.
